# Diabetes-Detection-Adaboosting-using-tuning-Algorithm-
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

# AdaBoosting With Hyperparameter Tuning — Diabetes Dataset

A lightweight machine-learning project applying AdaBoost to the Diabetes dataset, along with hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

* Load and prepare diabetes dataset
* Select 8 medical features (Pregnancies, Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.)
* Train–test split
* Apply AdaBoostClassifier
* Perform hyperparameter tuning
* Evaluate accuracy before & after tuning

---

## 📁 Files

* `Adaboosting_using tunning_diabities.ipynb` — full workflow notebook
* `diabetes_knn.csv` — required dataset

---

## 🔧 Requirements

Install needed libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
jupyter notebook "Adaboosting_using tunning_diabities.ipynb"
```

Ensure the CSV file is in the same directory.

---

## 📊 Summary

* AdaBoost helps improve prediction for medical datasets
* Hyperparameter tuning (estimators, learning rate) boosts performance further
* Useful mini-project for understanding boosting + tuning workflow
